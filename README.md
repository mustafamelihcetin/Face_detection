# Face_detection
 
This is a face detection script written in Python using OpenCV. The script captures video frames from the camera, converts them to grayscale, and detects faces using the Haar cascade classifier. Detected faces are then highlighted with green rectangles. Press 'q' to exit the program.

Dependencies:
- OpenCV

Instructions:
1. Install the required dependencies by running 'pip install opencv-python'.
2. Make sure the Haar cascade XML file is in the 'Cascades' folder.
3. Run the script and observe the live face detection.

For more information, refer to the OpenCV documentation.
